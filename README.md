# Overview

This repository serves as my personal dedicated space for practicing software testing. The primary goal is to enhance my current skills in quality assurance, such as writing test plans, test cases, and applying best practices for testing software.


## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
In this phase, the product manager or business analyst will first provide the requirements documents (e.g., functional requirements, user stories). I will then analyze these requirements to ensure they are clear and testable. Any ambiguities or gaps I encounter along the way, will be discussed with the product manager for clarification. Afterwards, I will document the testable requirements and criteria for success.

### Objective: 
To understand the requirements from a testing perspective and identify what needs to be tested.
### Required Deliverables:
- Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM): Maps requirements to test cases to ensure coverage.
- Clarified Requirements: Documented clarifications of any ambiguities or uncertainties in the requirements.
